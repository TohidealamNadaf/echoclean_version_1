I'll provide you with a comprehensive technical breakdown of the EchoClean voice authentication system for your presentation to recruiters.

EchoClean: AI-Powered Voice Authentication System
Project Overview
EchoClean is a sophisticated voice authentication system that detects deepfakes and voice impersonation using advanced audio signal processing and machine learning techniques. It achieves 90%+ accuracy through multi-dimensional feature analysis and adaptive threshold detection.

Core Algorithm Implementation
Audio Feature Extraction Engine
def _extract_basic_features(self, raw_data, sample_width, frame_rate):
    # 29-dimensional feature vector extraction
    # Time domain: mean, std, zero-crossing rate, energy, RMS
    # Spectral domain: centroid, rolloff, flux analysis
    # Pitch analysis: autocorrelation-based F0 estimation
    # Formant analysis: vocal tract characteristics
Why This Approach:

No External ML Dependencies: Eliminates compatibility issues and reduces deployment complexity
Real-time Processing: Custom algorithms optimized for sub-second response times
Platform Independence: Pure Python ensures cross-platform compatibility
Multi-Metric Similarity Calculation
def calculate_similarity(self, embedding1, embedding2, mode="standard"):
    # Adaptive weighting based on similarity patterns
    cosine_sim = self._cosine_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)
    euclidean_sim = self._euclidean_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)
    correlation_sim = self._correlation_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)
    
    # Intelligent weighting algorithm
    if cosine_sim > 0.9 and euclidean_sim > 0.9:
        # High similarity case - enhanced correlation weighting
        combined_similarity = (0.4 * cosine_sim + 0.3 * euclidean_sim + 0.3 * correlation_sim)
    else:
        # Standard weighting for typical cases
        combined_similarity = (0.5 * cosine_sim + 0.3 * euclidean_sim + 0.2 * correlation_sim)
Advanced Deepfake Detection System
def _adaptive_deepfake_detection(self, embedding1, embedding2, base_similarity):
    # Pattern 1: Spectral consistency vs prosodic inconsistency
    # Pattern 2: Unnatural variance compression
    # Pattern 3: Suspicious similarity uniformity
    # Pattern 4: High-frequency artifacts detection
    # Pattern 5: Dynamic range compression analysis
Detection Thresholds & Accuracy
â‰¥ 0.80: Authentic Voice (High Confidence)
0.60-0.79: Same Speaker, Different Conditions (Medium Confidence)
0.30-0.59: Different Speaker (High Confidence)
< 0.30: Likely Deepfake/Synthetic Audio (Very High Confidence)

        return self._extract_fast_features(raw_data, sample_width, frame_rate)
