Build a complete AI-powered project called “EchoClean” that detects deepfake voices or impersonation in real-time by comparing incoming audio (live or uploaded) to a known voice sample. This project prioritizes high detection accuracy (90%+) using real speaker embeddings and minimal HTML/JS/CSS frontend.

🎯 Objective:
Create a voice verification tool that:

* Detects whether the incoming speaker is the same person as a known reference.
* Flags impersonation, deepfakes, or different speakers using AI speaker embeddings.
* Uses threshold logic based on cosine similarity between embeddings.
* Shows real-time results in a minimal, user-friendly frontend.

🧠 AI Logic & Accuracy:

* Use ECAPA-TDNN (via SpeechBrain) or Resemblyzer to extract deep speaker embeddings from audio.
* Compare speaker embeddings using cosine similarity.
* Use the following threshold-based detection logic:

```python
if similarity >= 0.90:
    result = "✅ Authentic"
elif 0.75 <= similarity < 0.90:
    result = "⚠️ Possibly Different Speaker"
elif 0.50 <= similarity < 0.75:
    result = "❌ Different Speaker"
else:
    result = "🚨 Deepfake or Noisy/Corrupted Audio"
```

* Ensure at least 90% accuracy by testing with real voices and tuning thresholds.

⚙️ Backend (Python):

* Use Flask or FastAPI.
* Routes:

  * `/upload-reference` – Accept known voice sample
  * `/upload-target` – Accept new or live voice for comparison
  * `/analyze` – Return:

    * Cosine similarity score
    * Result label (Authentic, Different, Deepfake)
* Store files in `uploads/`, generate embeddings, compare, and respond with JSON.

💻 Frontend (Minimal):

* Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only (no frameworks).
* Allow user to:

  * Upload reference voice sample
  * Upload or record target voice
  * Press a button to “Compare”
  * Show result clearly with similarity score and verdict
* Optional:

  * Display waveform or progress bar
  * Color-coded results (green/yellow/red/gray)

📦 Python Dependencies:

* flask or fastapi
* resemblyzer or speechbrain
* librosa
* numpy
* scipy
* pydub
* whisper (optional)

🌟 Highlights:

* Accurate AI using real speaker verification techniques
* Detects impersonation with over 90% real-world accuracy
* No buzzwords — only real machine learning
* Minimal frontend for maximum performance
* Ethical use: helps fight AI voice fraud and scams

🦢 Optional Add-ons:

* Log each test to a local `.csv` for tuning
* Add a “recalibrate threshold” tool for custom environments
* Whisper-based transcript and phoneme consistency checker
